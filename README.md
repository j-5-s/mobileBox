#jQuery mobileBox

mobileBox is ajQuery plugine used to display a mobile 
friendly slideshow rather than a lightbox.  I love lightbox's 
(especially colorbox), however they always seem to suck on my 
ipod touch.  The image is always really small, the close button
is about 1px and impossible to click and sometimes the image 
is completely off the screen. This plugin will generate a mobile
friendly (ipod, iphone, android) image view.  It works with a 
single image or gallery with a similar api to 
[colorbox](http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox)
